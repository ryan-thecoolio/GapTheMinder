# GapTheMinder 🧠

The app was made for the *MindTheGap Challenge* Hackathon (3/21/25) by Ryan M., Bhavin M., and Heyaryx.

### What is APE Trading? 🐒
Ape Trading is a stock-simulation app designed to educate people on critically thinking about the devastating impacts of global misconceptions. For example, a study by Gapminder found that 86% of people believe most plastic waste is in the ocean.

This false claim reflects society’s collective attitude of our future. As a result, we become less inclined on working toward a greener and brighter future, that would have been possible if we removed our misconceptions.

In response, APE Trading is that combats biases by engaging users in simulation where individuals gain or lose money based on statements that are true or false. We believe that the value of virtual currency can support user’s valuing the negative impacts of spreading misconceptions. Ultimately, our goal is to encourage a positive change for the future through learning and a lot of fun!

### App Concept 💭
An app designed to raise awareness and remove global ignorance. This app is targeted to all people, but especially young adults as they are the future. They will shape the landscape of society. Since, as the crypto space is rising in popularity through coins like *Bitcoin* or many meme coins like *Doge*, we thought this idea would create humor, education, and critical thinking by users.

### Features 🚀
- **Multiple Choice Investment** ✅: We parsed data into a json file sourced from GapTheMinder website
